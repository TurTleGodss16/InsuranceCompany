Here is my mini project after I finished my Object-Oriented Programming subject at UOW. This is an application allows an insurance company controls and manages their users. Both admin and users can access user account and change any information (holder name, car - type of car, model, cost...), but just admin can access and change admin account information. I also have included all source codes, packages and libraries to run this program.
